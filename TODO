- axis titles
- legends
- group support
- facet support
- vertically centered labels
- everything is an expression
- ask each geom for its extents (right now aesthetics inferred by geoms don't go into calculating scales)
- assume unrecognized layer-level properties are mapping properties
- allow using ValueRefs to be explicit?

Error reporting
- when variables not present in data are used
- when an aesthetic is associated with a constant not present in its scale's range
- when a discrete aesthetic (e.g. shape) is associated with a continuous variable
- when a geom doesn't have all the aesthetics that it needs (e.g. bar needs x and y)
